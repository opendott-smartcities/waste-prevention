# Waste Prevention

Hi! I am Felipe Schmidt Fonseca, a Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher and PhD Candidate at [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/). [My research](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott) about waste prevention in smart cities is part of the [OpenDoTT project](https://opendott.org) and I'm moving to Berlin with another four colleagues to spend a period in the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/).

In the first year of research we were based in Dundee, Scotland, and worked on a design research approach to understand our different topics of investigation - all of them exploring trust in the internet of things through open design. During the summer we created concept ideas based on our research studies. Mine are [here](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott).

At the moment we are attending training in Internet Health and [open leadership](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/). In the next phases we'll be incorporating ideas of Internet Health and prototyping some of those concepts.

## This repository

I'll use this repository to refine ideas that will in the future be turned into prototypes of my research. My focus is on **waste prevention within smart city projects**. I intend to come up with solutions to approach this topic involving technology, governance and policy.

### Repository structure

## Background

This repository was created in October 2020 during the Internet Health Training offered to the [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org) fellows by our host in Berlin, [Mozilla Foundation](http://foundation.mozilla.org). I will document here parts of my research on smart cities. I'm also keeping a [research blog](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott) and a [list of links](https://links.efeefe.me/?searchtags=opendott).
