# Waste Prevention

This repository was created in October 2020 during the Internet Health Training offered to the [OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org) fellows by our host in Berlin, [Mozilla Foundation](http://foundation.mozilla.org). I will document here parts of my research on smart cities. I'm also keeping a [research blog](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott) and a [list of links](https://links.efeefe.me/?searchtags=opendott).

# Focus

I'll use this repository to refine ideas that will in the future be turned into prototypes of my research. My focus is on **waste prevention within smart city projects**. I intend to come up with solutions to approach this topic involving technology, governance and policy.
