### Spirals

Amid a couple days off I'm taking, I decided to watch a panel (as one does on holidays) organised by a Fabianne Borges, a colleague in Brazil, about "ethnoastronomy" and "archaeoastronomy". Around 25 minutes into the discussion, Germano Bruno Afonso [talks about the spiral](https://youtu.be/Cxmm7aFqkLc?t=1478
). I translate below a small excerpt from his account:

> "This one is a spiral, ok. And what about this spiral? (...) The most beautiful explanation I found was the following: this represents the beginning and the end. And that in our life we'll never be - we always say it's circular, right, represented by an ellipse - it means that whatever position we're returning to, even if things haven't changed, we have changed. So it is not the same. The circle does not close to become an ellipse."

I found it opportune, as yesterday I wrote right in [another part of repository](../spiral/README.md):

> (...) instead of countering linear thinking with mere circular shapes, I'm bringing something I learnt from a spiritual guide: the world always come back, but in a different shape. It spirals up and your challenges grow accordingly.
> Hence, spirals. Look everyone, there's a name! Spirals of openness? Open spirals?

Another session I attended earlier on my "day off" was an excellent presentation on "[Buen Vivir-centric design: Decolonising, identity and multiple worldviews](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/buen-vivir-centric-design-decolonising-identity-and-multiple-worldviews-tickets-124041317921)" followed by insightful discussion. The work of [Diana Albarr&aacute;n Gonz&aacute;lez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albarrandiana/) is great, and watching her talk was a good wake-up call to my own work and how it may relate to my own roots, decolonising and *buen vivir*.

At some point I jotted down a note on "common ancestral futures". And about "identification" instead of identity (a process instead of fixed categorisation). Finally, I was happy to be reminded of some of the Zapatista principle of "mandar obedeciendo", which has inspired a lot of what we did around the digital culture circles in Brazil. I will try to write more about all that in the near future.

Now back to holiday mode (or almost that... I still need to take my son to the dentist today).
