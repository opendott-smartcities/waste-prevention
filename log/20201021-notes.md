### Approaches to the commons

Here's some references I was collecting today after a call with a colleague. I am trying to push beyond the transactional "open" towards an understanding of multi--stakeholder "commons".

I'm still familiar with some of productions below, and am coming back to others after some years of having had my first contact.

- [What is Creative Commons?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPZTh2NKTm4)
- [Re-examining the Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyf_0SMAsFA&t=600s) - Lawrence Lessig TEDxNYED (around 10 minutes mark - Disney case, Sonny Bono copyright extension act)
- "A Letter to the Commons", in [In the Shade of the Commons](https://waag.org/sites/waag/files/Publicaties/InTheShade.pdf) (PDF) - pp. 19-21.
- [Everything is a Remix Remastered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc)

- "Ways of science: public, open, and commons" by Estalella and Lafuente, in [Open Science, open issues](https://livroaberto.ibict.br/bitstream/1/1061/1/Open%20Science%20open%20issues_Digital.pdf) (PDF) -  pp. 27-56.
- [Pirate Utopias: Moorish Corsairs & European Renegadoes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/449902.Pirate_Utopias), Peter Lamborn Wilson (on "pirate flags").

And some I've been involved with:
