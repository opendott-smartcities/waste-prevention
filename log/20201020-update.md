# Updates

Changed the name of this repository today. I had originally called it 'waste prevention', but ended up not writing much about my research per se. When the time comes I can create another repo.

I'm still documenting insights on openness against my own previous experience, and hope to write at least one blog post about it in the coming weeks.
