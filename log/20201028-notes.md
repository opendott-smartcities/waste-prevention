### Notes

Plenty of interesting things to read and watch (as usual):

- [Open and collaborative design processes - Meta-Design, ontologies and platforms within the Maker Movement](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/47213)
- [Afrofuturism: Reclaiming Cyberspace Virtual Event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eBJEx7fDnA)

Also worth mentioning: yesterday I joined Mozilla's Fellows Future Summit. Starting to feel part of that scenario, even though I don't sense its boundaries yet. The potential is almost palpable, but for some reason I'm keeping quiet. I think I don't want to rush into things, similar to my approach to Ubatuba a decade ago. I'll write about that in the [spiral](../spiral).
