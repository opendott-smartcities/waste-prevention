### Log - 27/11/20

After weeks going in circles (or rather, spirals), I have finally reached a version of my impressions after the internet health and open leadership training that I felt like sharing (version [0.2](https://opendott.org/posts/a-spiral-of-openness/), to be precise). I start making explicit that it's only a snapshot of ongoing reflections. I published also a copy on my [personal research blog](https://is.efeefe.me/opendott/spiral-of-openness). And the working copy will remain [at this repository](../spiral/spiral-of-openness.md), where it may still evolve, or not.

As the intention was to start multiple discussions, I've posted it to twitter. Within some hours I've got a [comment from Giles Lane](https://twitter.com/gileslane/status/1331955850970341378) with a link to a great essay called "[Book and Bilum](https://gileslane.net/2020/03/04/book-and-bilum/)" reflecting upon the materialisation of social webs into cultural artifacts (and much more, go there, read it, enjoy!):

>  Books which are not documents of knowledge or media containing information, but artefacts describing the relationships that make knowledge or knowing possible in particular places, between specific people. I used to wonder if our project was somehow contributing to a revivification of a local culture that was in danger of being lost to the swell of consumerism and rampant exploitation of natural resources that are the contemporary forms of colonialism. Now I am more of the opinion that it is being incorporated into a kind of local cultural dynamism that remakes itself as it works with the materials at hand, that articulates new relationships by evolving different kinds of ritual and exchange. What might readily appear as loss to us, so fond of our cultural heritage, provenance and history, might instead be resilience and adaptation without sentimentality.

It made me think of some of the projects of Sebastian Gerlic at [Thydewa](https://www.thydewa.org/projetos-realizados/) with communities of native Brazilians. They have for instance created books together with community members; made videos and set up an online portal to share contents; set up a residency programme in Olivença - Oca Digital - inviting artists, technologists and activists from all over to spend some time there. And finally, organised a [residency programme on electronic arts with native Brazilians](http://aei.art.br/) (full disclosure: I was - proudly - part of that project and one of the residents at OCA).

Another recent project that springs to mind is an online community of practice on archives and memory with which inception I was also involved with in Brazil, called [Transversalidade da Memória](https://www.itaucultural.org.br/transversalidade/). They are organising ongoing and extremely relevant discussions mixing pretty different perspectives about the field. It's only in Portuguese for the time being.

At some point I'll definitely need to find ways to connect those reflections with my own research on waste prevention in smart cities. I'm struck by Tim Ingold's image of the pencil stub that Lane used in that text. I do see a thin line that I may expand later on: can waste be thought of as a sort of unintentional or unconscious making of cultural artefacts?
