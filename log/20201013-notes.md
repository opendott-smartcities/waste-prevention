### Log - 13/10/2020

- Distinction betweem "project" and "community". Not always separate entities.
- Measuring is important. However, how much do we want to part from the real goals in order to provide measurable numbers? Outcomes are not always easily measurable.
- Break into simple problems. Always?
- Openness requires faith. What's the role of the apostate? Can we argue for doubt to be part of it? Same as incorporating errors into creative processes, perhaps.
- Reconfigure the whole project at each step, with each person that arrives or leaves. How will that be featured in these simplified models (vision, canvas, MVP)?

- Side note: up goer five... is it easier or harder for non native speakers?

- Before our meeting yesterday, I came across [this book review](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/books/review/the-weirdest-people-in-the-world-joseph-henrich.html). WEIRD - western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic (I would add 'male' to the mix, but that would ruin the acronym). While I love Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines (I have recommended them recently to colleagues creating an online community of practice in Brazil), I sometimes feel it is too rationalised in this very ("weird") sense.

- GitHub. Old question: how much are we willing to compromise? MS GitHub. Our laptops at the Uni: Microsoft Windows or MacOS. It's not a merely technical decision, it's about power.

### Notes while reading the Chapter 1 last Sunday

- Docx MacOS. Compromise? Culture of openness. Where's the threshold? Wear your production. Eat one's dog food.

- Browser Wars graph - where's Chrome?

About README:

- you **must** have (...). "A project, or a vision or idea of something you want to create / Having a project in mind or underway". Must I? Normativity (not a word in English, it seems?) of the "project" format. Amerindian communities - no such thing as "project" - plan, start, end.
- Mozilla creation myth says little about Netscape Communicator. Takes this knowledge for granted. How does it equate to primitive accumulation of capital?
- The word "ingredients" sounds a little too prescriptive for my taste. As things are predefined (I know, the idea is a cookie cutter framework, one size fits all - but how much are we giving up in terms of depths, reflexivity and systemic understanding?)

Hype count:

- A _great_ idea of something _amazing_ to make or build
- A _clear_ intention to share your idea, project and process _widely_

Chicken or egg?

- A group of contributors, which form a community to shape and drive your project

Sounds like a given, but not really (the "real" WWW, I mean)

- The world wide web to connect and collaborate

Only one?

- A project leader (this is you!)

Looking forward:

- A series of open practices and tools for planning, project management, mentorship, growing a community and running events, which weâ€™ll cover in this training.


I don't like reading "you should". Ever.

"user-centric" is a good idea when there are users. But that's a predefined role, right? I used to argue for rephrasing this as "people-centric", but that's arguably too broad. Recently I'm more inclined to think of stakeholders (probably aware of some of the limitations, sure).

- Found a typo on page 3. Two typos. Another one on page 4. ~~how do I submit a PR?~~ Got it, thanks girls! Already forked, will follow up.

- How about University Ethics approval? Different pace and restraints.
