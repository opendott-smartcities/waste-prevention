It's interesting that even before arriving in Berlin the focus of my research has anchored around waste prevention. There are so many initiatives in this field around here that the more I learn about them, the more I feel humbled.

In line with the critical take I already had on the triumphalist narrative of innovation and technology, it feels as though any idea I could have would not be enough to generate real impact. And yet, that may be precisely the way to go.

What if I start by not being that guy trying to convince everyone that his project is a game changer, the ultimate solution that deserves attention, funding and faithful followers? What if I understand that I'm just another person interested in contributing to a wider conversation that involves people from very diverse fields of knowledge and life experiences?

Perhaps inverting the way these things are often framed, it may be that instead of recruiting people to participate in my research, I should direct my work to become a participant in others' ongoing projects.
