It's interesting that even before arriving in Berlin the focus of my research has anchored around waste prevention. There are so many initiatives in this field around here that the more I learn about them, the more I feel humbled.

In line with the critical take I already had on the triumphalist narrative of innovation and technology, it feels as though any idea I could have would not be enough to generate real impact. And yet, that may be precisely the best way to go about it.

What if I start by just not being that guy trying to convince everyone that this project is a game changer, the ultimate solution that deserves attention, funding and faithful followers? What if I understand that I'm just another person interested in contributing to a wider conversation that involves people from very diverse fields of knowledge and life experiences?

Instead of recruiting people to participate in my (heroic/epic) research, I should then direct my work to become a participant in others' ongoing projects. My concepts would better be conversation starters - question marks instead of exclamations directed towards other people.
