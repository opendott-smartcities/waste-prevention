### Nonlinear

WIP

Many entry points to this (is that a meta discussion?).

I remember reading about the book Rayuela by Julio Cort√°zar around the time I was experiencing the early commercial internet in Brazil, in mid 1990s. Even having access to a computer in Brazil was a privilege then.

#### Then and now - hardware and privilege

As I entered the University and possibly after I insisted a lot, my mum and stepfather took me to a big electronics fair in Porto Alegre. We settled for a 5x86 with 4Mb of RAM. It was a sort of reward for having gained entry to a public University after a pretty competitive (and starkly unfair) process called vestibular: a series of tests (eight or so) performed in a single week where 17 year olds need to prove they have memorised as much as possible of what they were taught during 3 years of high school. Naturally, most of those tests are in areas not at all related to what one wants to study. For instance, even if I was applying to study media and PR, I still had to perform well on chemistry and biology. Anyway, I have a good memory - and some luck - and got in. I'll keep my University years for another turn of the spiral. For now, suffice to say my family felt as though I had the right to have a computer at home.

Wait, there I go widening the narrative and inserting lots of personal stories that are not necessarily related to the point here. Or are they? You know what? This is nonlinear and infinitely editable. Right now (28.10.2020, anniversary of my dear Brazilian place Ubatuba) I'm standing in front of my workstation at home in Berlin - a laptop I don't particularly like for both technical and ethical reasons, added of an external screen and a bluetooth keyboard that is not great but still better than the one in the laptop. I shouldn't be complaining though, as it is a privilege to have a device that, I admit, works quite nicely. The distance between this particular device and the one my mum bought to me in 1996 is hard to even consider.

As I mentioned, that first PC I had was a 5x86 with 4Mb of RAM and a clock speed of 133Mhz. I have no idea what the hard drive size was. The computer was to be paid in monthly installments. If [this](https://cosmos.bluesoft.com.br/tabelas/tabela-de-salarios-minimos) is right (and I think it is), the Brazilian minimum wage by then was 100 reais. Now look at this: I had the immense privilege in such an unequal place as Brazil of being in a family that could afford to buy an equipment that cost a lot of money. I'm not sure of the figures, but if I'm not mistaken the price of that computer should be R$ 999 for those who could pay upfront. With our generous (for the banks, of course) interest rates, the total cost of buying in installments was considerably higher. I wouldn't be that off-mark if I said we were paying 12 installments of 120 reais. Hence, my first computer must have cost 1,440 reais - or the equivalent of 14 months of salary for a worker under full time employment.

This laptop I'm typing into right now is still very expensive in Brazil due to many factors: the great devaluation of the brazilian Real in the last year, import duties and the cost of intermediaries. Something around R$ 15,000 these days. The minimum wage in 2020 is something around 1,000. Which means someone working full time in unskilled jobs will likely never have access to this fast machine with a crappy keyboard. On the other hand, these days there are many affordable alternatives to have access to information processing equipment. 

Are mobile phones the same?

My first PC was not fast. In fact, some weeks after the thing was delivered and finally installed, I got a coupon for a discount in the upgrade from Windows 3.11 to Windows 95, which all the newspapers were saying was the real thing. Yes, by then one would learn about tech from newspapers - the physical ones. Or tech magazines, which were expensive and sometimes came with floppy disks filled with freeware. I had been enamored of that world since years, but only had limited access to computers - a friend who owned a MSX where we would play Double Dragon, another one with a TK85. My dad's job, also. He was a punchcard operator in the 1980s, then became the head of the municipal technology department for some years. I attended extra-school tech classes, learning a bit of BASIC and COBOL. And yet, we had no computers at home - so not much space to practice. And there I was, aged 17 with a new computer which I would spend the nights exploring. And a box with loads of floppies to upgrade it to Windows 95. The process was not smooth, but I eventually finished. And the thing turned sluggish as hell.
