# A spiral of openness

! This is the draft of a text I am preparing for the OpenDoTT blog, as part of our training on Internet Health and Open Leadership. It feeds from the other materials shared in [this repository](https://github.com/opendott-smartcities/working-open). This paragraph will be removed once the text is finished, but will remain in the commit history. Forever? Who knows...

After an unusual summer (wasn't it?), my second year at the [OpenDoTT project](opendott.org/) started with a change of gears. Not only have I started to engage with the local context of Berlin - a scenario radically different from Dundee in many aspects related to reuse of second-hand materials -, but the whole project has a different focus on this phase. Our core activities last year were centred on design research. From now on, the other fellows and I are expected to start prototyping on top of our previous findings, as well as perform another round of fieldwork. That will be accomplished by bringing together both technical exploration made possible by open source hardware and software, as well as open methodologies inspired by [Mozilla](https://foundation.mozilla.org/).

## Proto-tech

I am not - by far - an expert on prototyping technologies. I have however an overall understanding of their potentialities and limitations. Some ideas on where they can be useful to make some of my [concept ideas](https://is.efeefe.me/concepts) more concrete and relatable are already emerging. I am for instance considering the creation of a machine that would recognise objects placed in front of its camera and display different kinds of information about them. Data on repairability, warranty, assistance shops, creative reuse and second-hand market, for example. The machine could be placed in public settings, flea markets, second-hand stores and the like. I'm looking forward to learning more about prototyping with the help of OpenDoTT consortium members and eventually putting my hands and head to work on ideas like this.

## Openness

It is however with the other theme of this year that I feel more comfortable engaging with and perhaps contributing more: "working open". That may have been my main motivation to apply to this program in the first place. When I applied to join the OpenDoTT project, I was required to write a motivation letter. For some reason, I had not shared it on the internet before today. [Here it is](https://github.com/opendott-smartcities/working-open/blob/main/spiral/motivation-letter.pdf) (hint: this very link is a seed for meta-discussion deriving from this text... there will be more of those). There I already mentioned some of the projects I had been involved with since well over a decade. Many if not all of them had elements of openness as core principles.

It was against that background that I attended the training module about internet health and open leadership recently offered by Mozilla to the OpenDoTT fellows. It turned out to be totally different from the experience I had last year during the design research training module. In that first case, I was in the mood of absorbing a structured, clear and neat approach to a set of practices I had used before in a more incidental and superficial way. Even though I was not totally new to participatory methods, I felt as though I was acquiring a more robust way to put them to use - learning how to design, conduct and analyse the outcomes of those kinds of experiments. When it comes to practices of openness, though, I do not come from a position of little experience. Rather, I carry with me a rich background of initiatives I have been involved with that not only dialogue with whatever is currently understood as open methods, but indeed challenges them in various ways.

My way through this training was fruitful also as an opportunity to reassess things I had read in the past, initiatives I have observed and projects I have been involved with directly. I was very conscious of not dominating the discussions with my colleagues, and for that reason whenever I had the chance to speak I didn't even know where exactly to start. I feel as though when we talk about open methodologies there are separate universes, and there are very few points in which they overlap. For that reason (along with some annoying personal matters still unsolved), it took me a little longer to write about the theme. I decided that it would be impossible to write briefly and in a linear way about my perceptions, and decided to use the repository I created for the training as a place to brainstorm and store unstructured insights. What follows are some notes based on that documentation. They are incomplete and insufficient, but may prove a good way to start conversations.

## Loose notes / seeds for conversation

### WEIRD

Right before we started the training on internet health and open leadership (in that very first morning, if I'm not mistaken), a message in the [nettime mailing list](https://nettime.org) drew my attention. Yes, I'm still a lurker in some of those mailing lists from times past. In any case, there was this message, never replied, mentioning a book review titled "[Why Are We in the West So Weird? A Theory](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/books/review/the-weirdest-people-in-the-world-joseph-henrich.html)". I'm not reading the book, but found the acronym funny: Western, Educated, Industrialised, from Rich and Democratic countries. It is apparently a way to acknowledge how much current common sense is biased towards the imaginary of people coming from that kind of background. Some weeks later I found another mention to WEIRD while (audio-) reading Kate Raworth's "[Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut_Economics:_Seven_Ways_to_Think_Like_a_21st-Century_Economist)" (no, I'm not a fan of that image - will comment some other time). Under the risk of ruining a clever wordplay, I would contend an alternate version, though:

- Western/white/northern and male;
- Educated, or rather “taught” a biased worldview;
- Industrialised, often seizing on externalities;
- Rich - based on structural unbalance or war;
- Democratic, or so they say... and believe.

It was not only that book review, of course. I am obviously more aware of such contextual setting nowadays than I was the first time I learnt about free software two decades ago. But that email prompted me to be even more explicitly aware of it as the training went on. It was sometimes amusing, and in others disheartening to realise how much a WEIRD perspective is at the core of the free/open cosmogony. Some of its tropes deserve a better critical attention also, particularly that of the lone hero taking on the world - not surprisingly, it's often a white man, healthy (if sometimes addicted to substances), well skilled in tech and with perfect domain of the language spoken by authorities and the elite. To be honest, I myself have been that guy more than once in Brazil.

Fortunately, there have been extensive critique to that. One of the ones I like the most, and had the chance to re-read in its paper edition in Berlin, is "In the Shade of the Commons: Towards a Culture of Open Networks", published by the Waag Society in 2006 ([PDF here](https://waag.org/sites/waag/files/Publicaties/InTheShade.pdf)). Therein lies the "Letter to the Commons", which starts like this:

> Greetings! This missive arrives at your threshold from the proverbial Asiatic street, located in the shadow of an improvised bazaar, where all manner of oriental pirates and other dodgy characters gather to trade in what many amongst you consider to be stolen goods. We call them ‘borrowed’ goods. But a   difference in the language in which one talks about things (‘stolen’ vs, ‘borrowed’) is also a measure of the distance between two different worlds.
> You can only steal something if it is owned by someone in the first place. If things are not ‘owned’ but only held in custody, then they can only be ‘borrowed’ as opposed to being stolen. So what you call a ‘pirated’ DVD is what we would call a DVD ‘borrowed’ from the street, and the price we pay for it    is equivalent, or at least analogous to an incremental subscription to the great circulating public library of the Asiatic street.

In other words: who are you to claim you have property over an idea to be able to share it under an open license? There's a lot to be discussed there, but I'll only point to a parallel to the idea of [primitive accumulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_accumulation_of_capital) (and add that to the list of topics about which I need to read a lot more).

### Open... or what?

What does "working open" oppose to? An usual take is to think in terms of binaries - "open vs proprietary" being a prominent one. But what does that opposition denote?
