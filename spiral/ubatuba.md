Moreover, there are barriers to dialogue and collaboration among
different actors—particularly between non-local scientific communities and locally situated social groups—including barriers of language, of knowledge and technical skills, as well as of cultural backgrounds. The interaction between actors with different interests, worldviews, and epistemic structures implies conflicts and negotiations of distinct— often divergent—agendas, expressing asymmetric relations of power. There are significant asymmetries between those who can make use of open knowledge and collaborative practices in their interests, and those who contribute to the common knowledge but do not benefit from it. Therefore, although collaboration is a crucial part of knowl- edge production, it begs the question: Collaborate for what purpose, with whom, and under what terms?

Another barrier is the fragility of existing free and open software
and web infrastructure with open-standard protocols for data sharing. We still very much depend on corporate tools such as Google Drive and Dropbox for the majority of online data sharing and collabora- tion. These tools have a high level of reliability and efficiency in the short term, and thus the adoption of free, open-source software is encumbered by more subjective obstacles such as the culture of use and inertia, informal support networks, crowd behaviour, and sig- nificant investment on user interface cross-platform usability. At the same time, high expectations around free, open-source software can be disappointing when a misconfigured service fails. Unfortunately, this is a deep-rooted and long-term threat, in a distributed context that often relies on a network of unpaid developers.

The institutional dimension proved to be a central aspect affecting the open and collaborative nature of knowledge and its potential to bring about social change. We conceive institutions as “formal and in- formal rules that are understood and used by a community … [They] are not automatically what is written in formal rules. They are rules that establish the working ‘dos and don’ts’ for the individuals in the situation that a scholar wishes to analyze and explain” (Hess and Ostrom 2011, 42).

But even if it is possible to have an institutional framework that
promotes Open Science, when it is confronted with conflicts over development, the limits on the quality (or deficit) of democratic par- ticipation become evident and constitute a barrier to the potential use of openness in building alternative forms of development. That is, even if knowledge is open and free, when considering the powers and decision-making systems in different spheres and on different scales, this openness often loses effectiveness. In other words, legis- lated formal equality does not necessarily imply effective equality to make use of and benefit from the results of openness in knowledge production and circulation.

Alternatively, we observe that the very idea of openness is under
dispute (Albagli, Maciel, and Abdo 2015). We are thus left to ask “What (open) science and for whom?” Furthermore, the idea of sci- ence itself is under dispute, and this dispute lies at the core of today’s democracy building. A democratic sense of openness corresponds to the enlargement of the social base and dialogue of science with other social actors. Open Science expands, or rather transcends, the so-called “scientific field” (Bourdieu 1975). In this sense, Open Science does not refer solely to the clash between public and private forms of knowl- edge production and appropriation, and it is not limited to increasing the speed of knowledge circulation within the field of science itself. Open Science does not concern only the potential or facility for gen- erating or circulating information and knowledge within the so-called “scientific community” (or communities). It implies the overthrowing of hierarchies, of established sources of authority and reputation, and moving the focus to the relationship between science and power and, from a broader perspective, to the relationship between knowledge and power. Open Science is not simply a form of knowledge produc- tion and sharing that complements and democratizes decision-making on the cognitive level; it also puts into perspective the role of cognitive subjects in their respective positions of power.

From this point of view, we expanded our conceptual framework,
considering the idea of common science as proposed by Lafuente and Estalella (2015), which focuses on the relationship with the diversity of modes of knowledge production. Common is used not only in the sense of common goods (the commons), but mainly common as “in between,” the relationship with Otherness, with the Other. Lafuente also considers the common as the ordinary, that which is not sacred or hierarchically superior, which means that science is part of an eco- system of modes of knowledge. It is still not possible to say to what extent the Open Science movement will contribute to the destabilization of existing scientific epistemological and institutional frameworks and practices. It implies the need for a new agenda of rights, new ethical-po- litical issues, involving power relations between science and society.
