# Spiral #1

//Berlin, 20.10.20//

My first note: I lost track of how many projects I must have started with a couple loose paragraphs being published in the open and later heavily edited by myself and others. This very file may become another one of those. I start it after being through a training module on Internet Health and Open Leadership offered by the Mozilla Foundation as part of my (and my colleagues') PhD at Northumbria University.

Now, I am one of those annoying guys always picking up on things that may appear very small to others, but do indeed put me off. I am writing right now in a device that does not have a truly open Operating System. And I'm documenting it on GitHub, which is of course based on git and offers a strong support for free/open communities worldwide. But it belongs to a company who spent a lot of effort trying to discredit the very same free/open communities for some decades, which raises honest doubts. Can I trust them?

Trust. It is one of the central tenets (am I using this word correctly? no spellchecking on this editor) of the OpenDoTT project. Trusted things, trust. So much to discuss around trust, technology, organisations, collaboration and our own project.

As I tried to sort through the copious notes I made during the training last week, I realised it would be hard to react with a single, coherent text. In fact, it feels somehow the same as it did as we met to discuss the course materials and everytime I decided to participate I did not know even where to start. So I decided I would not react with a single-thread text. I can not do that, and that's indeed part of my critique. I hope I can get there.

In the second day of the course I turned my phone's video camera on and talked freely, in Portuguese. I ended up with two videos, more than 40 minutes altogether, of redundancy and malformed explanations. The next day a friend asked me to watch them and I sent them to youtube, then left to a Capoeira class. Ah, sorry to be wasting your time - I always find opportunities to sneak personal stories in everything I write. Anyway, when I was coming back home I received an SMS from my new mobile provider saying (auf Deutsch) that I had used up more than 80% of my monthly allowance of 3Gb. The videos! I would have imagined that youtube would not keep uploading once my phone changed from wifi to mobile, but I'd be wrong. Once I arrived home I noticed that not only it did use up my quota, but the whole thing failed at some point and there was no video online. I took it as a sign and gave up on that path too.

I "believe in signs", yes. Not a fan of Paulo Coelho, though. Not as a writer, at least. Nor anything else, to be honest. I'm not sure I am a fan of anyone. Except Gilberto Gil, of course.

Stream of consciousness? Not quite. I'm not going on a single direction. Perhaps a thick, deep stream as those of the Amazon basin rivers. But no, if anyone has the patience to read, I will attempt to experiment with different takes on openness. If I am successful, it will be hard to follow and comprehend. And that's intentional.

I'll do some hopscotch here. And instead of countering linear thinking with mere circular shapes, I'm bringing something I learnt from a spiritual guide: the world always come back, but in a different shape. It spirals up and your challenges grow accordingly.

Hence, spirals. Look everyone, there's a name! Spirals of openness? Open spirals?
